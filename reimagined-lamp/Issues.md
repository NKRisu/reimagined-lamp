## 1. Session Management
**What is wrong?**
- The session management is currently using an in-memory store, which is not suitable for production environments.

**How did you find it?**
- The code snippet `const sessionStore = new Map();` is marked as to-be-replaced.

**How should it work/What should be fixed?**
- Implement a database-backed session store for better scalability and persistence. For example, use Redis or a relational database to store session data.

## 2. Security Headers
**What is wrong?**
- The security headers are set globally, but there is no check for existing headers, which might lead to overwriting important headers set by other middleware.

**How did you find it?**
- The function `addSecurityHeaders` sets headers without checking for existing ones.

**How should it work/What should be fixed?**
- Modify the `addSecurityHeaders` function to check for existing headers before setting new ones to avoid conflicts.

## 3. Password Hashing
**What is wrong?**
- The code uses bcrypt for password hashing, which is not ideal for modern security standards.

**How did you find it?**
- The `registerUser` function in the registration code uses bcrypt to hash passwords.

**How should it work/What should be fixed?**
- Consider using a more modern and secure hashing algorithm like Argon2, which is designed to be resistant to GPU cracking attacks and provides better security.

## 4. Error Handling
**What is wrong?**
- There is a lack of error handling in the route handlers, which can lead to unhandled exceptions and poor user experience.

**How did you find it?**
- The route handlers do not have try-catch blocks or error handling mechanisms.

**How should it work/What should be fixed?**
- Implement error handling in each route handler to manage unexpected issues gracefully. For example, wrap the logic in try-catch blocks and return appropriate error responses.

## 5. Static File Serving
**What is wrong?**
- The `serveStaticFile` function does not handle MIME types correctly for all file extensions.

**How did you find it?**
- The `getContentType` function has a limited set of MIME types, which might not cover all static files.

**How should it work/What should be fixed?**
- Expand the `getContentType` function to include more MIME types or use a library to handle MIME types dynamically.

## Comparison to a Working System

- **Session Management**: A working system would use Redis or other system instead of inmemory.
- **Security Headers**: A working system would ensure headers are not overwritten.
- **Password Hashing**: A working system would hash passwords using better algorintm.
- **Error Handling**: A working system would have more comprehensive error handling with try x.
- **Static File Serving**: A working system would handle all MIME types correctly.
